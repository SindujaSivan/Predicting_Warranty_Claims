**Project Write-Up: Predicting Forklift Warranty Claims**

**1. Introduction:**
The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for a forklift manufacturer to anticipate warranty claims based on various features of the forklifts. By predicting warranty claims, the manufacturer can proactively address potential issues, improve product quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.

**2. Data Collection:**
The dataset used for this project contains information about different forklift models, including features such as production year, engine type, lifting capacity, operating hours, geographical location of usage, and whether a warranty claim was filed. The data was systematically generated to simulate real-world scenarios.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
Before building the predictive model, the data underwent preprocessing steps such as handling categorical variables (e.g., converting them into dummy variables), splitting the data into features and target variable, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

**4. Model Selection and Training:**
Several classification models were evaluated for their ability to predict warranty claims:
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine

Each model was trained using default hyperparameters and then tuned using grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters.

**5. Model Evaluation:**
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances of warranty claims and non-claims.

**6. Selection of the Best Model:**
The best model was selected based on its performance metrics. In this project, the F1-score was prioritized as it provides a balance between precision and recall, especially in cases of imbalanced classes.

**7. Predictions and Recommendations:**
The selected model was then used to make predictions for new forklifts. By inputting the features of a new forklift, the model can predict the likelihood of a warranty claim. This information can help the manufacturer make informed decisions about maintenance, product improvements, and customer support.

**8. Conclusion:**
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the value of predictive modeling in anticipating warranty claims for forklifts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the manufacturer can enhance product quality, reduce warranty costs, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. Further refinements and enhancements to the model can be made based on ongoing data collection and analysis.

**9. Future Work:**
- Incorporate additional features or data sources to improve model performance.
- Explore advanced techniques such as ensemble learning or deep learning for more accurate predictions.
- Continuously monitor model performance and update it as new data becomes available.
